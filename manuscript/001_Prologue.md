# Prologue

I'm an engineering manager, a tester and a programmer and would never think of forcing pair programming on my team. I find myself, however, being the person who regularly suggests pair programming and mob programming as mechanisms of solving many of the problems of not having shared knowledge for my team.

I work with a team that rarely pairs. We have paired on several occasions:

  * New person is joining and assigned a tutor with the goal of having them through their first change going to production within the first week

  * Teaching my specialty: exploratory testing (includes programming)

  * Fixing bugs I find from the testing I do as I refuse to report Jira tickets

  * Learning a practice or a technique solely for the purposes of learnings

People in my team find the idea of someone hovering over them when they work pressuring, feel uncomfortable being put on a shared schedule with another person and giving up freedom and generally not having good experiences of pairing.

Personally, I've had enough good experiences with pairing that I say yes to pairing when given a chance. I find most of my pairs online, and pair with them remotely. The core principle for pairing is consent. People need to opt in. They need to want to pair. I cannot deal with the pressure of convincing someone who does not want to work in a pair, or doing the emotional labor of being positive when the other is seeking excuses to get out.

Pairing, at its best is brilliant. Building on ideas of the other, actively finding better ways of doing things, and both contributing and learning are worthwhile. It's creative, yet also productive.

Getting to a place where I started to love pairing wasn't a straightforward route for me. It took me discovering the idea that there are different styles of pairing I could use to negotiate a pairing situation that enabled me to contribute and learn best. I started to enjoy pairing as I learned about **strong-style pairing**, and it was a transformative experience driving me to fulfill a goal set some years ago: writing a book about styles of pair programming.

When I say pair programming, I mean any activities around programming. It could be pair design. It could be pair testing. They all fall under the pair programming umbrella.

I hope lessons I've drawn prove useful for your growth in pair programming. Finding the words to describe the differences have been essential for me in negotiating pairing contracts that make me comfortable and productive.
