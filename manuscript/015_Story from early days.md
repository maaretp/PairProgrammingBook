# Story from Early Days

As I had realized there were such a thing as Strong-Style Pair Programming, I set out in 2015 to interview some people who had early experiences.

My perception is that this style of pair programming started off from being a backseat driver, adding just enough listening and kindness, and including consenting in most cases to make it what we know of it these days.

The earliest stories from podcasts are around the idea that a programmer felt better than others and was paying the other's salary while training them. They resulted in backseat driving, where the person on the keyboard quit the company before ever becoming a navigator themselves.

The better stories evolve into both parties in the pair taking both roles, even with the dynamic of strong-style in place.

## Origins

20 years ago, a programmer had a good first experience pairing. Being a junior, a senior took them under their wing, sat them next to a keyboard and told them what to type. They learned a lot, but also, as the senior's ideas were flowing through their fingers, they could speak back, suggest different ways, question what the direction was and control the pace of how things flowed between the two of them. Having a view into how a senior would do this, while bring in control of the pace was a great experience.

The first great experience defined pairing for them for years. They modeled after the first experience, pairing so that whoever had the idea, was not at the keyboard. They realized they did something different only when they started going to Agile conferences and finding other programmers who were pairing regularly.

The response to their style of pairing was not a welcoming one. For people being surprised by it, it was thought of as arrogant and going into details of how to use an IDE. For people looking at it from the outside, it looked bossy and even argumentative.

The difference became clear, and the community had a realization: there were two significantly different ways of sharing the roles and responsibilities in a driver-navigator pair. The traditional way and a way that was named Strong-style pair programming by Arlo Belshee.

Strong-style pair programming of the early days could often be indistinguishable from backseat driving. The folklore includes stories of a pair refusing to ever move from driver to navigator and leaving company stressed about the style.

But as often happens with practices, they mature as more people look into them and as people themselves grow. When an arrogant junior developer realizes that arrogance isn't helping them, they learn kindness, consideration and respect. They learn that a pair is two people, and that both have things to contribute and stepping back may be necessary for some people to contribute in the first place. I believe these lessons are what turned the early Strong-style pair programming away from backseat driving, and into a pairing style of its own.

## Learned at Agile 2015

I interviewed someone with Strong-Style Experience in Agile 2015 conference on August 7th. Here's an edited transcript.

I was in a session at an agile conference. They were talking about a developer and tester pairing and benefits of that. And it was a great session. And the really cool thing was that it was really hands-on.

So we were pairing at a table. I had this guy there. The guy was kind of cocky. He’s got like blue hair and and I’m pairing with him. I’m like "great". And we’re using Eclipse and I don’t know eclipse a lot. And he asked me that. He noticed my hesitation and said “how well you know this IDE”. And I said it’s not my thing. And he says that’s ok, because I’m going to tell you what to type. And I thought maybe he thinks I’m new to pair programming or something and I don’t know about this, but no, I was in for a whole new world of understanding. Because the person introduced me to what is now modified to be called Strong-Style pair programming.

He told me what to do and told me what to type. And when you think type something very high-high level but no. He told me the very low level of “type this word”, “press enter”, “press semicolon”, “you need a curly brace there”. And I was not allowed to use the mouse, he was like “no, no, no, it’s control+shift+R”. “Ctrl+shift-m”, “alt+r for that”. I was like “what” and thinking “keep it cool, keep it cool” because inside I was about to boil over and just be furious.

And I noticed something was happening. I noticed I started to know what extract method was. I started to pick upon some things. I started to understand the syntax better. And his language started changing as this happened. He started talking at a more abstract level. And his instructions started moving to a higher level. And we were actually picking up speed. And I was like “holy smoke, there’s something to this”. The guy is like completely obnoxious and annoying at first. But there was really something here.

## What is there here?

There are a few lessons to draw from the story.

   * Both people in the pair can choose to make the best out of every experience, and keeping your mind open when you feel something wrong is happening can be a useful trait

   * Not explicitly clarifying that there is a special style of pair programming at play may not be the best option to introduce this style as navigator as it makes you appear self-absorbed and placing yourself above the other

   * With hands on keyboard and a strong-style pair programming experience, the navigator can use words to transfer knowledge in a way that is actionable for the driver learning the knowledge.

   * It looks like backseat driving and without consent can be very uncomfortable

   * The session was on testing and was hijacked to be on IDE use - the backseat driver's preferred thing to teach
