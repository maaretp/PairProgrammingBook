# Grow you Wizard before You Need them

Making teams awesome is something I care deeply for, so it is  no wonder that discussions I have with people are often on problems around that. Yesterday again I suggested pairing/mobbing at work to receive cold stares and unspoken words I heard in the last place I worked: "You are here to ruin the life of an introvert developer". I won't force this on people,  but they can't force me not to think about it or care about it.

As I talked about the reactions, and was pointed out a story he has been talking about many times before. And with "just the right slot" in my calendar, I go and write about it. Someone else will probably make an awesome video when they get to it.

Some of us have some sort of history with computer games. Mine is that I was an absolute MUD (multi-user dungeon) addict back in the days, and I still irregularly start up Nethack just for nostalgic reasons. In many of these fantasy game types, we fight in teams. And we have characters of different types. If you play something that is strong in the beginning, you survive early on more easily. The wizards on low levels are particularly weak, and in team settings we often come to places where we need to actively, as a team, grow our wizard. Because when wizard grows to its high level potential leveling up with others support, that's an awesome character to have in your team.

A lot of times we forget the same rule goes around growing people in our teams. The tester who does not program and does not learn to program because you don't pair and mob could be your wizard. The new colleague could be your wizard. At least the results of being invited to "inner circle" fixing problems by identifying them as they are being made feels magical.

Just like in the role plays, you need to bring the wizard fully into the battle, and let them gain the XP, you need to bring all your team members into the work, and find better ways for them to gain experience and learn.

Pairing isn't for you. It is for your team. It's what you can give to your team and change the dynamics of who knows all this stuff.

## Pair Testing with a 15-year-cold

A few months back, I had the pleasure of working with a trainee at F-Secure. As usual in schools in Finland, there was a week of practice at work with the options of taking a job your school assigns you (I did mine at age of 15 in an elderly people home) or you can find one of your own. This young fellow found one of his own through parents, and I jumped on the opportunity to pair test with him.

At first, he did not have a working computer so it was natural for us to  get started with strong-style pairing:

**With an idea from my head to keyboard, it must go through someone else's hands.**

He was my hands, as I was testing firewall. And in many ways he was a natural in this style of work. He would let me decide where to go and what to do, but speak back to me about his observations and ideas, extending what I could see and do all by myself. Most of the things we did together were things I would have done by myself. Only difference was the times of going to the whiteboard to model what we knew and had learned, where I guided him to navigate me in the ideas to document very much in the same strong style pairing. As the driver drawing, I would ask questions based on our shared testing experience when he would seem to miss a concept.

His ability to test grew fast. He learned to use the application. He learned to extend his exploration with test automation that existed and play with it to create the type of data we wanted.

My reward was to see him enjoy the work I love so much. His words on the end of our joint experience without me prompting still make me smile: "I now understand what testing is and would love to do more of it".
