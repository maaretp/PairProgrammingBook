# Don't be a Backseat driver

A backseat driver is a passenger in a vehicle who is not controlling the vehicle but who excessively comments on the driver's actions and decisions in an attempt to control the vehicle. A backseat driver may be uncomfortable with the skills of the driver, feel out of control since they are not hands on the controls, or want to teach the driver while the driver has controls. Many backseat drivers make remarks on speed, or give alternative directions. The tool the backseat drivers use is their voice. Sounds a bit like Strong-Style Pairing?

There is, however, a distinction between a backseat driver and a navigator.

  * **Consent**. A navigator has been, by mutual agreement, been positioned in a role of helping the driver succeed. A backseat driver opts into the role without negotiating a contract of acceptable behavior.

  * **Shared Intent**. A navigator shares intent of achieving a common goal with the driver and is helping to achieve the goal. A backseat driver inflicts their own intent assuming they know better.

  * **Trust**. A navigator is someone trusted, helping the driver to keep eyes on the road. A backseat driver is inflicting help where it is not invited, and often distracts from the driving task at hand by being noisy, distracting and generally not helpful.

Before I was aware of styles of pairing, I found that negotiating the pairing contract, especially when working in uneven knowledge level pairs was particularly difficult. I found myself often hands off keyboard, pairing traditionally and zoning out because following someone when you cannot be fully engaged takes a lot of energy. To maintain energy, I found myself in a backseat driver role, trying to think of what I could contribute and calling out instructions where they were not welcome. Becoming aware of the option of strong-style pairing was helpful in clarifying what were our expectations in how we would work in the pair.

Depending on who you pair with, either style might work. If the pair is able to pass the keyboard back and forth frequently, that also creates the engagement. There can however be many things in the way of passing the keyboard:

   * One of the pair feels uncomfortable in the other role

   * One of the pair knows significantly more about the work the pair is about to do

   * The pair is separated physically in two different locations and switching control requires setup

   * One of the pair has the programming environment set up and using their computer creates a barrier to actively switch hands on the keyboard

When negotiating the contract, you can shorthand to the two style options:

   * strong-style pair programming - "I have an idea, you take the keyboard, and I'll keep track of what we should do next"

   * traditional pair programming - "I have an idea, give me the keyboard, and review my tactical choices for me focusing on the strategic choices"

Both of these can be appropriate, depending on who you are pairing with and under what constraints. You need to agree on the style to have mutual understanding of how you work together this time. With a new session and new pair, at the beginning I know the least of my pair and I can default to my favored style: Strong-style pair programming with me as the driver (if working on programming) or me as the navigator (if working on testing), aiming for a regular switch of keyboard access.

Having both in the bag is good. The lesson here is that you should take a moment to negotiate the pairing contract. Especially people who have hard time connecting to the other on emotional level and hearing when words are not used, strong-style can become an act of forcing your opinions over the other just as hogging the keyboard in traditional-style would.

At a workshop, a friend of mine ended up pairing with a stranger. They had only done pairing in workshops with me, where I introduce and enforce strong-style for the connection, but also make the rules and expectations clear. Now they were told to pair, with someone who does not pair, and the setting was far from optimal. There was a skills difference not in their favor and as they ended up watching the more experienced one, they quickly fell off the loop of what was even going on. The computer they paired on belonged to the other and they wouldn't share it because it was set up just right for work. And the only way to pair my friend was taught was strong-style that really increases newbie involvement in uneven pair. It was clear they did not enjoy it. They left half way through the three sessions.

If anyone had run into a particularly inconsiderate experience with strong-style pairing, because without setting up the relationship with consent, strong-style pairing can easily be indistinguishable for backseat driving.

Let's stop to think about that for a moment. What does good pairing look like? It looks like doing work by two people, where both are engaged in the same work. To be engaged, you need to be there willingly. And opting in to pair isn't always willing, if you did not know what is coming up.

Thinking about the roles in a car is helpful in remembering what it could look like.

  * **Driver** is always the person on the controls. No matter what anyone else says, driver has the ultimate power of taking things their way.

  * **Navigator** is helping the driver. Navigators can be well versed in the big picture not paying attention to the road, or know the details of the road and help step through the route in an optimal way. In traditional pairing, navigator reviews. In strong-style pairing, navigator controls the high level choices with words.

If you had a **backseat driver** in the car, that person would be like a navigator, but operating without consent. That person could be very engaged in the pairing, but their input wasn't welcomed or accepted by the driver. A backseat driver might be exactly like a strong-style navigator. The difference is in the contract, that is often implicit, and the assumed power difference.

The difference between a backseat driver and strong-style navigator is consent and trust. The first delivers unwelcome guidance and the latter provides instructions asked for, on a level they are able to and that they find necessary.
