# Good Pairing

I used to believe that pairing would work for me when pairing with the right person. I could name a hundred people I had paired with, and a handful of them where the pairing was truly enjoyable. Contributing and learning was not enough, if it came with the price of being uncomfortable with a pair on work I could do also alone with less discomfort.

To give you an idea of what kind of experiences I now seek, I'm sharing my good pairing memories.

## Strong-Style Pairing on Selenium tests

We were a team of 10, and we really had not paired at all. The general atmosphere was allowing it, and we got started with close collaboration with a weekly mob programming session. Mob Programming is like strong-style pair programming turned up. Instead of having a pair to navigate you when you sit in front of a keyboard, in mob programming you have a group of navigators for the one driver. And as a group, you work to get the best out of everyone into the work you're doing.

The group work built relationships, and from those relationships we started pairing. We needed to have more of user interface test automation with Selenium, and it made sense to pair people with ideas of what needed testing with people who were aware of what had already been implemented.

As we were starting to pair, we talked briefly about the idea of strong-style pairing, and I took the turn first at the keyboard. We debugged an existing test, and sitting at the keyboard it was easy for me to follow the structure as we were navigating through it. We got the test fixes, and changed roles.

I had a test in mind I wanted us to add, and we drafted the idea of it as comments. We then proceeded on selecting a piece that would make sense to do first, finding an existing helper method we could extend I did not know existed, discovered the design we wanted to use with me keeping track of the test ending up doing what it was supposed to do in the end.

We changed back and forth, each completing a piece on and off the keyboard.

I knew things I had not known before, and had actionable knowledge as I had been the hands moving through it. I also knew I could, off keyboard, speak in terms of what I wanted implemented, working with someone well versed with the details of this particular implementation.

The discussion would ping pong between us. One would say something, the other would add to that for the benefit of building the best possible code we could for the purpose we were fulfilling, using both of us in full.  

At the end of the hour and a half, we had added new tests, extending existing helper methods. Looking at what we had, we couldn't say who contributed what. It was all better because it had both of our contributions. It had been reviewed, its design challenged, and we had tested the implementations. It was like both of us were on our best behavior, showing only the good sides.

## Good Pairing Gives You...

   * Learning things you did not know

   * Avoiding mistakes you'd learn about later

   * Avoiding rework based on late feedback

   * Building better things on the get go

   * Help on hard problems that make you feel stuck

   * Innovations on easy problems that make you feel like you're wasting both of your time

   * An end result neither one of you could do alone, faster together
